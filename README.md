# React skills test

## Premise
This is a non-working app, your task is to make it work with what we expect.
Update: App is already done.

## Notes
Api endpoints used are from [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). A fully working version is available [here](https://react-skill-test.vercel.app/)

## What we expect
- `/posts` endpoint must be called only once
- No re-rendering must happen
- No console errors
- No build errors
- No turning off of eslint (by line, by file or globally)
- No infinite loops
- No hacks
- No additional libraries to be installed (except for adding redux)

## Extra points
- Unit tests
- Implement routing of Posts => Post page
- Implement fetching of user author
- Implement the use of redux

## Submission instructions
Please create a [git-bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle/) and send the file across discord
